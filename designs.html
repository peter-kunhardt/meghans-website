  /*Hello students - there are a lot of tips in this code to help you as you work through this assignment.  To begin read the assignment so that you know what the outcome will be.*/
  /*FIRST TIP:  In CSS, WIDTH is not the same TOTAL WIDTH.  TOTAL WIDTH is the entire space that an element takes up.  WIDTH is the space for the content only - it does not include padding, borders and margins that go into TOTAL WIDTH. (you learned this from the "BOX MODEL" ðŸ˜‰) */

  /*      SMALL SCREENS      */
  /* These styles apply to small screens */

    width: 90%;
    padding: 0px;

  /*      MEDIUM SCREENS      */
  /* This is our first media query.
     The styles here apply to screens that are 600px wide or wider
     This uses Layout Option A
     Tip - all CSS properties and values are inherited from the CSS for the small screen.  This means that you only change the properties and values that need to change
     Tip - all of the selectors have been included in this code.  You don't need to add any other selectors.  You will need to add the declarations (the properties and values) */

Ships of Antiquity were assembled by the mortise and tenon fashion.

    <p>In 1807 the American Robert Fulton created the first steam-driven ship. It had a wooden hull and used paddles. Around 1830, ships propellers were gradually developed by several inventors, including Josef Ressel, John Patch and Francis Pettit Smith. During the next 150 years, steam or combustion engine ships would compete against sail. The last great sailing ships were in service in South America in the 1950s.</p>

    <p>During the 19th century, iron and steel gradually took over the wooden hull production. Steel was preferred since it is stronger than iron, and from the 1870s, steel was used instead of the weaker wrought iron plates. The first iron and steel hulls were riveted, but from the 1940s and onwards, steel ships are usually welded. </p>

    <p>Modern yachts, like the private luxury yacht seen in this photo is made of fiberglass.  It all starts when the mold is created.  The mold is sprayed with gelcoat, then fiberglass cloth is applied, and then resin is used to saturate the fiberglass. When the resin cures, you have a hull of a boat. </p>
    <p> The yacht shown here measures an incredible 180 metres, making her one of the longest private luxury yachts in the world. This floating palace was launched by Lurssen in 2013.  On its seven decks you'll find a helipad, a salon measuring 520m&#178; and, as rumour has it, even a private submarine and antimissile system. </p>
    <p class="hide">This beauty was the highlight of last years Monaco Yacht Show and it's not difficult to see why. While passengers can pamper themselves in the gym or sauna, with a massage or at the hairdressers, at night the whirlpool turns into an open air party under the Monaco skies.  A one week holiday on board this yacht will cost one million dollars, but for only 175 million you can buy the whole thing.</p>
